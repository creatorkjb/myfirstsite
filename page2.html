<h1 style="color:#80ff80;">On page2, I thought it would be fun to try changing the background and font colors.</h1>

<p style="color:#80ff80;"> This is a new paragraph. I've learned about HTML tags such as head, body, style, color, paragrpahs and breaks.

<p style="color:#80ff80;"> <b><A HREF="page3.html">To visit the third page of my webisite, click this hyperlink.</A></b>

<br> <b><i style="color:#80ff80;">This is a new sentence without a paragraph break, in bold italics. Can you see the difference between this paragrpah and the one above? Usinng different tags, I can create different structures that can easily be read. </i></b>
