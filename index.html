<h1> Hello World</h1>

<p>I'm Kian Brockbank, and I'm hosting my very first website here on GitHub Pages. While there are many options you can choose to make a website, I wanted to learn code that actually makes the web pages and figure out how to make my very own website using HTML. While you can you WYSIWYG-style applications like Dreamweaver and Rapidweaver to create sites without any knowledge of coding, the benefits of learning HTML are more than knowing how to build a site from a simple text editor. With a basic understanding of the code, you can create more complex pages using CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) as well as incorporate other coding languages to create interactive sites. </p>

  <p> I chose GitHub Pages to create and host my website after my dad showed me how it was a perfect fit for student projects.
